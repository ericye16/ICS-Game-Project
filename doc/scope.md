I See Chess Game
===========
A chess game written for ICS.

Part 1
---------
### Project Background ###
Our primary goal is to create a chess game. This game will allow the user to play against a friend or the computer. The board will be shown in 2 dimensions with pieces. The game will know all the rules of chess and show the user possible moves when the user selects a piece to move. If an AI is included, it will not be trivially easy-to-beat. Users will be able to use an API to program their own AI’s and then pit them against ours. We hope to provide an enjoyable experience and perhaps a challenge to everyone who enjoys playing or learning chess.

### Needs Assessment ###
The stakeholders of our program are people who are interested in creating their own AI”s, people who are interested in using a chess program for some purpose. The users will be those who are interested in playing chess with friends or against an AI. Stakeholders will need the program to be decently presented, user-friendly, and well made. Users need the program to provide an enjoyable experience while playing chess.

### Vision Statement ###
The aim of I See Chess is to give users a simple and intuitive interface that allows them to play chess against other humans or against the computer, while simultaneously giving developers a simple and intuitive API for developing and testing chess engines.
### Features to be Developed ###
The I See Chess program must be able to display a chess board and give humans players the ability to move chess pieces. The chess pieces must move according to the rules of chess. The program must be able to validate (check the legality) of moves played and indicate when users have checkmated the other.

It will also have an intuitive API for developers to use if they want to write another chess AI to play against. This allows developers to write chess AIs without having to worry about the user interface and move validation.
### Features that may be Developed ###
The program may ship with its own AI, which will not be trivially easy to beat. In addition, the AI may have a slider to allow its difficulty (and “thinking time”) to be varied.
### Features not to be Developed ###
The program will not include 3D graphics as found in many implementations of chess. As well, the included AI will not be competitive or have grandmaster-level skills, since one of the purposes of the game is to allow developers to write their own chess engine.
